# Control Prefixes for Parameter-efficient Text Generation! ðŸš… 
This is the implementation of [Control Prefixes for Parameter-efficient Text Generation](https:)

This technique extends Prefix-Tuning, a parameter-efficient technique that tunes prompts at every layers of the transformer and keeps the base LM fixed. Control Prefixes was the first paper to prefix-tune T5 and therefore show how powerful this architecture can be for Structure knowledge graph tasks such as Data-to-Text.

Control Prefixes or LayerControl extends the prefix-tuning framework by having multiple control prefixes for data-point level information. This can inform the model at every layer of attribute-level information and fits into the prefix-tuning framework by sharing the same reparameterizations. Control Prefixes outperforms other methods of conditioning on attribute information that only operate on the token level. 

As a result the technique is state-of-the-art on several datasets:

Installation
------------

```
cd ControlPrefixes
bash setup.sh
unzip src/data.zip
unzip src/datatotext/utils.zip
```
Usage
-----

Data-to-Text datasets with conditional data-point attribute information is provided at [`src/data/`](src/data/processed/). For XSum, sample files are provided. 

Each model config is contained in the config folder. E.g. For data-to-text at [`src/datatotext/configs/`](src/datatotext/configs/). Edit the data and output directory paths, gpus. To use distributed training refer to the Pytorch-Lightning docs. 

To run training, e.g. for the original 2017 WebNLG.
```
$ cd src/datatotext 
$ python read_yaml.py configs/webnlg17_config.yaml
```
